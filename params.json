Also includes support for standalone months. (`\"%B %Y\"` should be Grudzie≈Ñ 2009, but `\"%d. %B %Y\"` should be 24. grudnia 2009).\r\n\r\nBased on [Russian](http://github.com/yaroslav/russian/) by [yaroslav](http://github.com/yaroslav/).\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n*Warning*: as of version 0.1.0, polish is only tested with Rails 3 and Bundler. Use with caution, might give unexpected results.\r\n\r\nTo add Polish to your Rails app, simply add it to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n`gem 'polish', github: 'Sija/polish'`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you change the backend of I18n, you will need to make sure it includes the Pluralization module:\r\n\r\n`I18n.backend.class.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Pluralization)`\r\n\r\nWhat it does\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe main feature of polish is fixing the date formats. It does that by setting the date.month\\_names and date.day\\_names translations to Procs that can detect the proper form.\r\n\r\nPolish also adds correct pluralization rules.\r\n\r\nOverrides\r\n---------\r\nTranslations and date formats can be overridden in `config/locales/pl.yml`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
